#Classify Images into Specific Classes Using Multi-Layer Perceptron.
The dataset is similar to MNIST but includes images of garmentsand accessories. The objective is to classify images into specific classes using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).
Dataset:Total Images: 70,000Train Images: 60,000Test Images: 10,000Image Size: 28 X 28
Different Classes:Classes: T-shirt/Top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle Boot.

MLP using TensorFlow for fashion MNIST data to determine all 10 classes. 
epoch= 2000 
Create 4 layers using keras
Compile the model by defining Cost function as cross entropy and Optimizeras Gradient Descent.
Now, initialize variables, cost function and optimizer to initiate the training.UseAdam as the Optimizer.
